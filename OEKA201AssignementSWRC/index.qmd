# Introduction

  Goal of this paper is to showcase skills    learned during programming part of the      course by implementing R language into      Quarto document.

## Exercise 1 from Problem Set

### Models

Would like to refer to [@wickham2023r] and [@bjornar].

Model 1: One variable and linear 

Model 2: Two variables and non-linear

# 

### Text part

Here are the plots the get a better understanding of the models after.

### The frequency distribution of the categoricals variables :

```{r}

usedvw <- read.csv("usedvw.csv")
data("usedvw.csv")
freq_table <- table(usedvw$model)

barplot(freq_table, main = "Frequency distribution of model",
        xlab = "Model", ylab = "Frequency")
```

model 1 = Amarok; model 2 = Golf; model 3 = Golf SV; model 4 = Passat; model 5 = Polo; model 6 = Scirocco; model 7 = Sharan; model 8 = T-Roc; model 9 = Tiguan; model 10 = Touareg; model 11 = Up;

```{r}
data <- read.csv("usedvw.csv")
freq_table <- table(usedvw$transmission)

barplot(freq_table, main = "Frequency distribution of transmission",
        xlab = "Transmission", ylab = "Frequency")
```

Transmission 1 = automatic; Transmission 2 = manual; Transmission 3 = semi-automatic

```{r}
data <- read.csv("usedvw.csv")
freq_table <- table(usedvw$fuelType)

barplot(freq_table, main = "Frequency distribution of FuelType",
        xlab = "FuelType", ylab = "Frequency")
```

FuelType 1 = diesel; FuelType 2 = petrol

Now, let's see the correlation between age and price.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)


ggplot2::ggplot(usedvw, aes(x = age, y = price)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Correlation graph between age and price",
       x = "age", y = "price")
```

### Descriptive statistics

```{R}


data <- read.csv("usedvw.csv")
descsum <- summary(data)
descsum
```

### Estimations

Model 1



Model 2



### Predictions



Predictions for the Model 1



Predictions for the Model 2




# Conclusions

**Number of words in the assignment:**

```{R}
library(stringr)

count_words <- function(quarto_file) {
  contenu <- readLines(quarto_file)
  nombre_mots <- sum(str_count(contenu, "\\S+"))
  
  cat("Word count :", nombre_mots, "\n")
}
count_words("index.qmd")

```

## Appendix

added an example (adjust with what you have)

```{r}
#| label: fig-mod1
#| fig-cap: 'Model1'
knitr::include_graphics("price_mileage.png")
```

@fig-mod1 shows GRETL output ...
